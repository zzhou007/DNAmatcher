# Created:     10/25/2015
#
# Instructions:
#
# 1) Make sure to rename the file (studentNetId.py) to your netId. (Do not include your first name, last name ... or any extra character)
# 2) To run the program type the following statement in the command line:  
#       -) python studentNetId.py DNASeq1FilePath DNASeq2FilePath OutputFilePath                                                                   
#    where  DNASeq1FilePath is the path to the file that contains First DNA sequence (e.g. DNASeq1.txt)
#           DNASeq2FilePath is the path to the file that contains Second DNA sequence (e.g. DNASeq2.txt)
#           OutputFilePath is the path that the output is goint to be saved (e.g. out.txt)
# 3) Make sure to replace FirstName, LastName, SectionNumber, NetId in studentInfo with your information
# 4) You may add as many functions as you want to this program
# 5) The core function in your program is DNASeqAlignment function, where it takes three arguments (DNASeq1,DNASeq2,outputPath) and 
#    computes the similarityScore, sequenceAlignment1 and sequenceAlignment2. At the end, the function writes the result to the output file (Do not make any changes to the output section).
# 6) sequenceAlignment1 and sequenceAlignment2 are strings and they are composed of following characters: 'A', 'T', 'G', 'C' and '-', Do not include extra space or any other character in the strings.
# 7) Make sure your program works with at least one of the following python versions: (2.7.9, 2.7.8, 2.6.6)
# 8) Once you have tested your program with one of the versions listed above, assign that version number to pythonVersion in studentInfo function
# 9) Make sure to write enough comments in order to make your code easy to understand. 
# 10) Describe your algorithm in ALGORITHM section below (you may add as many lines as you want).
# 11) To understand the flow of the program consider the following example:
#      0) Let say we have DNASeq1.txt file which contains AACCTGACATCTT and DNASeq2.txt file contains CCAGCGTCAACTT
#      1) If we execute the following command in the command line: -) python studentNetId.py DNASeq1.txt DNASeq2.txt out.txt
#      2) input arguments are parsed       
#      3) studentInfo() function will be executed and the output will be saved in out.txt file
#      4) DNASeqAlignment() function will be called
#      5) At the entry of the DNASeqAlignment function, DNASeq1='AACCTGACATCTT' and DNASeq2='CCAGCGTCAACTT'
#      6) You should compute the sequence alignment of DNASeq1 and DNASeq2. Let say the result is as follows:
#       A A C C T G A C - - - - A T C T T
#       | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |
#       - - C C A G - C G T C A A - C T T      
#      7) At the end of the DNASeqAlignment function sequenceAlignment1='AACCTGAC----ATCTT', sequenceAlignment2='--CCAG-CGTCAA-CTT', similarityScore=6.25
#      8) In the output section the result is going to be saved in out.txt file
